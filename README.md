Think back to when you were little. Our childhoods were filled with such simplicity yet they were so vibrant. Whether it be the joy of a brochure for the Scholastic book fair, the feeling of showing off a new Silly Band for your collection, or the excitement of making a new fortune teller to have everyone play at school, the 90s/early 2000s were an amazing time to grow up. ✨

Our phones do so much to connect us to people near and far and open up opportunities, yet the bonding and memories that these relics from our childhoods brings often surpass the feeling of scrolling on Instagram or texting others. 💖

Many of us would give anything to go back in time and relive the amazing time we had in our childhood. Nostalgia Mall does just that! Take a trip down memory lane and “shop” online for some of the most nostalgic 90s/early 2000s goodies. 🛍

Like Jackie from Codédex said during her session on Friday, nostalgia is a way for us to grapple with how things have changed and how we want the future to be. This website brings back the toys and fun we had when we were little in a way that we’re all used to — online shopping (I promise, if this was in-person, I would do my best to set up a little pop-up shop) — and bring back your 90s/early 2000s bedroom to 2024. 😇
